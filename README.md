A tool in progress for quickly hacking games that use Microsofs's compiler and virtual classes\


Planning on adding import/export so you can save your reversing progress
Export will have both binary project file and also a json/text dump of the data
Import will only use the project file to read data back in, Import will have to Dump
before reading in the saved file data.
